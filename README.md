# Fake_or_real_news

Training data was downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/fake-news/data) and various classifiers developed using 
sklearn in python 3 on Jupyter Notebook platform. A comparison between various classifiers - multinomial bayes, logistic regression,
lda, qda and random forest is reported, using the title of the articles. Also, a comparison is reported for the text in the body of
the articles for mnb and logistic regression reported. Then, using nltk, bag of words created to understand the frequencies of the 
words in both real and fake labeled articles!
